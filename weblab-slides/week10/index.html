              <ul>
                <li>Your HTML goes to the browser and search engines.</li>
                <li>A search engine will parse your HTML and know what the content is based on how you write your code.
                </li>
                <li>Search engines looks at semantics to determine the hierarchy of the information.</li>
                <li>One of the most important elements for SEO is the title tag.</li>
                <li>Correct use of header tags is important.</li>
                <li>The most important keywords should be in the title and article heading.</li>
                <li>On each page of your website, spiders look for title tags, H1 tags, meta descriptions, URLs,
                  internal links and the alt text on your images to help categorize your content.</li>

                <li>Nothing beats having good content that's regularly updated.</li>
                <li>Search engines crawl your content to try to better understand it, organize it and prioritize it.
                  These spiders look for signals that your content is high-quality to assign a spot for your content in
                  search rankings.</li>

            an important part of our everyday lives. <br> <b>Google Ads</b> is a <b>PPC (Pay-per-click)</b> advertising
            platform that gets into consumer eyes, just when they are searching for something on Google.</p>
          <p class="med-text">Google Ads is the most popular PPC platform, but it's not the only one. <b>Bing Ads,

                <li>When you set up a PPC campaign, every time someone clicks on the ad, the advertiser pays Google (or

                  Google a certain amount of money. The amount you pay depends on the <b>keywords</b> you're bidding on
                  and the competition for those keywords.</li>
                <li><b>CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions):</b> You pay Google a certain amount of money every time your
